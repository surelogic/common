# The com/surelogic/common/images/ directory under 'src' must
# be included in the plug-in or references from the 'plugin.xml'
# files in other plug-ins can't find the images when packaged.

# Normally, Eclipse does not include the src/ directory in the
# packaged plug-in.
#
# The com/surelogic/common/images/ directory should only contain
# images, no Java source code.
