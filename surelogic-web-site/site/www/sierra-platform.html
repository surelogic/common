	    <h1>The Sierra Platform</h1>
	    <p>
	      <strong><em>Know Your Code</em></strong>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Sierra is a bug management platform that helps developers deal with
	      the often overwhelming number of findings produced by popular source
	      code analysis tools when analyzing large codebases.  For example, a
	      typical 1MLOC app may yield close to 50,000 individual
	      findings. Developers know that some are critical while others may be
	      insignificant or spurious. Sierra is designed to help you quickly
	      zoom-in to the findings that matter to you, to handle them rapidly,
	      to see what's new and different from the last scan, and to
	      coordinate activity across a team, in harmony with existing ALM
	      tools and software development processes.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      It comes bundled with a suite of popular open-source analysis tools,
	      along with a proprietary scanner and the capability to integrate
	      additional analysis tools. It installs as a single IDE plug-in,
	      providing a unified, multi-tool perspective on the code. It has a
	      powerful GUI to enhance developer productivity. Additionally, it can
	      be directly incorporated into an automated build process, with
	      results easily browsed and acted on by team members. Finally, it
	      generates reports and metrics to help team leaders gain visibility
	      into their development process and better coordinate the handling of
	      analysis findings.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Sierra consists of an IDE plug-in and a Team Server. The plug-in is
	      compatible with Eclipse 3.2+ and IBM RAD 7, with other IDEs on the
	      way.  The Team Server can be installed in three ways: (1) on a
	      developer's local machine for smaller projects or for trial
	      purposes, (2) on an on-site team server, or (3) hosted by SureLogic
	      in a SaaS model.

		<strong>How can source code analysis help you?</strong>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Rule-based analysis tools quickly scan your code to find
		common faults that may affect performance, security,
		readability, and maintainability of your code.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Scans can be done within your IDE in the background
		while you code, or as part of your automated or nightly
		build to find bugs before they bite.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Analysis tools can help assess the quality of code that
		you receive from other teams and 3rd parties &ndash;
		open-source, outsourced, etc.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		With explanations of each bug found and suggestions for
		how to fix, our analysis tools can also help you learn
		tips and tricks to produce cleaner, faster, and more
		understandable code.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Beyond &ldquo;bug hunting,&rdquo; Sierra provides
		tracking, reporting, and collaboration functionality, so
		you can work effectively with your team, your
		management, your suppliers, and your clients.
