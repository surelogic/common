	  <h1>Privacy</h1>
	  <p>
	    This Web site is administered by SureLogic, Inc. We want you to feel secure when visiting our site and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The following provides an overview of how we protect your privacy during your visit. 
	  </p>
	  <h3>What information do we gather?</h3>
	  <p>
	    Information on the SureLogic website is gathered in two ways: (1)
	    indirectly (for example, through our site&#39;s technology); and (2)
	    directly (for example, when you provide information on various pages
	    of the website).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One example of information we collect indirectly is through our
	    Internet access logs. When you access the SureLogic website, your
	    Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our
	    Internet access logs.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We collect information directly from you in a number of ways. One
	    way is through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of
	    information which save and retrieve information about your visit to
	    our website - for example, how you entered our site, how you
	    navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to
	    you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. (If you are
	    uncomfortable regarding cookies use, please keep in mind you can
	    disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in either
	    Preferences or the Options menu in your browser.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We also collect information that you voluntarily submit to
	    us. Throughout our site, we provide the opportunity to register for
	    special information, order a document, or participate in an online
	    survey. When we collect this type of information, we will notify you
	    as to why we are asking for information and how this information
	    will be used. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to
	    provide it.
	  </p>
	  <h3>How do we use this information?</h3>
	  <p>
	    We analyze it to determine what is most effective about our site, to
	    help us identify ways to improve it, and eventually, to determine
	    how we can tailor the SureLogic website and our products and service
	    to make them more effective and useful for our visitors and
	    clients. We may also use data for other purposes, which we would
	    describe to you at the point we collect the information.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Will we share this with outside parties?</h3>
	  <p>
	    We do not sell information about individuals and any information we
	    receive will be shared only with our advisors. There may be other
	    times when we wish to share information, for example, with our
	    alliance partners in complete confidence. Before you submit any
	    information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for specific
	    information and it is completely up to you whether or not you want
	    to provide it.
	  </p>
	  <h3>What about sensitive personal data?</h3>
	  <p>
	    We do not generally seek to collect sensitive personal data through
	    this site. If we do seek to collect such data, we will ask you to
	    consent to our proposed uses of the data. We may also collect some
	    sensitive personal data incidentally. By providing us with
	    unsolicited sensitive personal data, you consent to our using the
	    data subject to applicable law as described in this notice. The
	    references to &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; are to the various
	    categories of personal data identified by U.S. and other data
	    privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some
	    circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent. These categories
	    comprise personal identity numbers, personal data about personality
	    and private life, racial or ethnic origin, color, nationality,
	    political opinions or convictions, membership of political parties
	    or movements, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs,
	    trade union membership, physical or mental health or handicap,
	    genetic code, addictions, gender, sexual life (including sexual
	    orientation), pregnancy, property matters or penal or criminal
	    conviction or record (including where a pardon has been granted).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    While we take steps to maintain the security of surelogic.com,
	    you should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such
	    that data may flow over networks without security measures and may
	    be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is
	    intended.
	  </p>
	  <p>

	    creating an information resource for your benefit. If you have any
	    concerns or questions about your use of this site or how we handle
