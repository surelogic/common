	  <h1>Aaron Greenhouse</h1>
	  <p>
	    Aaron Greenhouse, Ph.D., is a Senior Software Engineer for
	    SureLogic, Inc.  He is the principal designer and implementor of the
	    lock-based concurrency analysis used by JSure, as well as other
	    analyses and frameworks critical to the operation of JSure.  This
	    analysis was originally developed as part of his dissertation.
	    Dr. Greenhouse has eight published papers on the topics of Java
	    concurrency analysis, assured program evolution, and static program
	    analysis.  Dr. Greenhouse is a contributor to JSR-305
	    &quot;Annotations for Software Defect Detection.&quot; He was a
	    member of the program committee for the &quot;Synchronization and
	    Concurrency in Object-Oriented Languages&quot; workshop at OOPSLA
	    2005, and has been a reviewer for numerous Software Engineering and
	    Programming Language conferences and workshops.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Prior to joining SureLogic, Inc., Dr. Greenhouse was a Member of the
	    Technical Staff at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), a
	    federally funded research and development center sponsored by the
	    U.S. Department of Defense and operated by Carnegie Mellon
	    University.  At the SEI, he contributed to the reference
	    implementation of the Society of Automotive Engineers Architecture
	    Analysis and Design Language (AADL), an industry standard
	    architecture description language for describing and analyzing
	    properties of real-time and embedded systems.  He also contributed
	    to the development and implementation of a family of &quot;data
	    quality&quot; analyses for architectural attributes such as data
	    security, data accuracy, and data confidence.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Dr. Greenhouse earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie
	    Mellon University in 2003, and his BA in Computer Science from
	    Brandeis University.<br />  <br />
