	  <p>
	    Dr. Scherlis is a Professor in the School of Computer Science at CMU.
	    He is director of CMU's Institute for Software Research and founding
	    director of CMU's PhD Program in Software Engineering. Dr. Scherlis was
	    lead Principal Investigator of the recently completed High
	    Dependability Computing Project, in which CMU led five universities to
	    help NASA address long-term software dependability challenges. He
	    co-founded SureLogic Inc. to commercialize technology resulting from
	    his research, which focuses on software assurance and evolution and
	    technology to support software teams.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Dr. Scherlis has been an adviser to major IT companies. He
	    has more than 70 scientific publications, and has led or
	    participated in national studies related to cybersecurity,
	    e-government, crisis response, analyst information
	    management, Department of Defense software management, and
	    health care informatics infrastructure. He has testified
	    before Congress on innovation and information technology,
	    and, previously, on roles for a Federal CIO. Dr. Scherlis
	    interrupted his career at CMU to serve at DARPA for six
	    years, departing in 1993 as senior executive responsible for
	    research and strategy in computer security, information
	    infrastructure, and other topics. He joined the CMU faculty
	    after completing a PhD in Computer Science at Stanford
	    University, a year at the University of Edinburgh (Scotland)
	    as a John Knox Fellow, and an A.B. at Harvard University.
