	  <h1>Timothy J. Halloran</h1>
          <p>
Tim Halloran is a software engineer with over two decades of experience developing and maintaining government and military software systems for the U.S. Air Force, NATO, and industry.  His experience includes simulation, weapon system test analysis, and airborne command and control software systems.  He has led several development teams in efforts to modernize large (above 1 million LOC) legacy systems—redeveloping operational software systems using modern software and hardware technology while at the same time enhancing the system to support current operational requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
Halloran is currently the Director of Engineering at SureLogic, Inc.—a small company that produces state-of-the art program analysis tools. He holds a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, an M.S. in Computer Engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology, and a B.S. from the U.S. Air Force Academy.  His research interest is in practical artifact analysis—direct positive assurance of software properties by the examination of a system’s code.  In addition, he has studied the portal tools and techniques used to enable distributed collaborative software development by successful open source projects.  He has published papers on open source software practice and program analysis. He has been a technical reviewer on several books, including Effective Java by Joshua Bloch.
