    <p>JSure helps keep your <em>code consistent</em> with your <em>design intent</em>. JSure supports almost&nbsp;<a href="/static/eclipse/docs/promises/">50 open-source annotations</a> to <em>tersely</em> (typically one or two lines) express non-trivial design intent in safe concurrency (including lock use), null references, mutability, internal access to state, abstraction bypass, API/structural pattern compliance, and many other properties.</p>

      <p class="title">This video presents how JSure supports the verification of the annotations proposed by Goetz et al. in the book Java Concurrency In Practice: @ThreadSafe, @NotThreadSafe, @Immutable, and @GuardedBy. Examples from the open source Timing Framework project are presented, as well as from SE for Android / Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The examples highlight the fact that only a small number of annotations are needed to enable verification results, even at large scale (i.e., no false negatives) -- and that these annotations almost completely eliminate false positives.<br></p>

  <p class="stayingray stayingray-1">Analysis-based verification: Stay in the gray!</p>
  <p class="desc1">Analysis-based verification is different from today's crop of static analysis tools. Those tools scan code and match known bug or style patterns. While useful, this approach has a problem: the tools are guessing if code is really defective. When they guess wrong they report a <em>false positive</em> (where the tool says there is a fault and the code has none). Rarely do vendors of these tools discuss the insidious issue of&nbsp;<em>false negatives</em> (where the code has a fault and the tool is silent).</p>
  <img class="stayingray stayingray-2" src="images/stayingray.png">
  <div class="desc2">
    <p>JSure does not guess about your program or use pattern-based analysis. It knows your intent because you expressed it as one or more annotations. JSure "stays in the gray" and avoids <em>false negatives</em> through the use of annotations. It may be surprising that JSure can still report false positives, however this is rare in practice and has to do with the theoretical limitations of static analysis (i.e., the verifying analyses used by JSure are conservative).</p>
    <p>To distinguish JSure from other static analysis tools we refer to it as an <em>analysis-based verification</em> tool. We use the term <em>heuristic static analysis</em> tool for analysis tools that find bugs or style problems based upon known anti-patterns. &nbsp;Both are useful in practice. Our offering in heuristic static analysis is the <a href="./sierra.html">Sierra</a> tool.</p>
